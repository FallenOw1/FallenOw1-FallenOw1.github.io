                <h2>How we're Helping</h2>
                <P>ASHH is a 501c3 non-profit organization focused on helping make the world around us a better, happier place. We were founded to save animals from neglect, abuse, and abandonment. We are an excellent alternative for owners who must give up their cherished pets. Our team of tireless volunteers cares for our foster dogs as a family. We are based on placing all our animals into loving foster homes, where they live with and become part of our foster family until they find a forever home. Every animal in our care receives proper medical care, nourishment, and the socialization needed to discover a new life without hunger, sickness, loneliness, or fear. 

                    We are guardians of these animals, which you trust us to protect. 100% of the money donated to us is used to care for our animals. Our entire organization is comprised of dedicated animal-loving people who receive no compensation for their countless volunteer hours. We joined this team for the camaraderie and joy we get from working together to help men's best friends in the most important journey of their lives.Â  </P>
